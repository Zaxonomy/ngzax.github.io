*Caveat Coder:* Althougn I am an experienced coder, I am relatively new to [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/),
so this could easily be "something you shouldn't do." All feedback is welcome.

After reading and observing for a while, I finally decided to jump in and create my first
test [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) app.

Everything was going swimmingly until I added a migration that included some SQL to add
a [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) extension so I could use a citext column.

{% highlight elixir %}

  def up do
    execute("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;")

{% endhighlight %}

Suddenly I was getting errors that looked like this when running my tests:

    ** (ArgumentError) no extension found for oid `25022`

Fortunately, a search led me to a [GH comment](https://github.com/ericmj/postgrex/issues/98)
which gave me the solution.

The problem was, in the words of [ericmj](https://github.com/ericmj),

> "Postgrex fetches types from the server when the first connection to
> the datasebase is started (when your ecto repo starts) so if you run
> migrations after the application starts it wont work."

The solution was to alias the "test" mix command and insert
the call to drop and recreate the DB *before* the application started, like so:

{% highlight elixir %}
  defp aliases do
    [
      "ecto.setup": ["ecto.create", "ecto.migrate", "run priv/repo/seeds.exs"],
      "ecto.reset": ["ecto.drop",   "ecto.setup"],
      "test":       [&setup_db/1,   "test"]
    ]
  end

  defp setup_db(_) do
    # Create the database, run migrations
    Mix.Task.run "ecto.drop",    ["--quiet"]
    Mix.Task.run "ecto.create",  ["--quiet"]
    Mix.Task.run "ecto.migrate", ["--quiet"]
  end

{% endhighlight %}

This worked great, my tests all passed!

Unfortunately, there was a hitch. You see, I like to have my tests running continuously. For this,
I have been using [mix_test_watch](https://github.com/lpil/mix-test.watch). Because it runs continuously,
it tries to re-execute "mix test" while the app is running and thus hits the same error again!

I banged around on this for a while with a couple of dead ends until I finally hit upon a solution.
I changed the pre-test method to only recreate the DB if the app isn't running:

{% highlight elixir %}

  defp setup_db(_) do
    unless List.keyfind(Application.loaded_applications(), project[:app], 0) do
      # Create the database, run migrations
      Mix.Task.run "ecto.drop",    ["--quiet"]
      Mix.Task.run "ecto.create",  ["--quiet"]
      Mix.Task.run "ecto.migrate", ["--quiet"]
    end
  end

{% endhighlight %}

Now, both standalone "mix test" and "mix test.watch" work and as a side benefit, mix_test_watch is a bit faster!
