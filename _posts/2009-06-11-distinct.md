In the course of trying to answer a question for my wife this
evening, I ran across an interesting type of query that, though it would
seem simple and common, I am fairly certain I haven't ever written in my
entire career.

The essence of the problem is "how do you perform a grouping query
while simultaneous removing duplicates."

So, for example, if you had the following data set:

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>B</th>
    <th>C</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a</td>
    <td>b</td>
    <td>c</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a</td>
    <td>b</td>
    <td>c</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a</td>
    <td>d</td>
    <td>e</td>
</table>

If you were to do the standard GROUP BY 

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT a, b, COUNT(c) FROM test GROUP BY a, b ORDER BY a, b;=
{% endhighlight %}

against this table, you would get the following:


>> a     b     count    
>> ----  ----  -------- 
>> a     b     2        
>> a     d     1        


However, my wife didn't want that duplicate "c" in column "C" counted.  

Here's the query I used (in PostgreSQL) to achieve that:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT a, b, COUNT(b) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c FROM test) AS t GROUP BY a, b ORDER BY a, b;
{% endhighlight %}

resulting in:

    a     b     count    
    ----  ----  -------- 
    a     b     1        
    a     d     1        


In retrospect, the reason this probably never came up is because with good data, you really shouldn't have duplicate rows, but you don't
always control your input data.  :)
