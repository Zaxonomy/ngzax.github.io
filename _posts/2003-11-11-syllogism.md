[Interesting article by Clay Shirky](http://www.shirky.com/writings/semantic_syllogism.html) about

> "We can't disallow generalizations because we can't know which statements are generalizations by looking at them. 
> Even if we could, it wouldn't help, because generalizations are a fundamental tool of expression."
