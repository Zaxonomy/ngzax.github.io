On the [Yahoo!](http://yahoo.com) [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) group
[Kent Beck](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/Kent%20Beck.htm) observed the
following in the thread "TDD is Kanban for Code":

I often tell myself as I code to just let some duplication and/or "smell" live
there for a bit.  Don't feel like you have to fix everything immediately, but
rather wait until I can clearly see the commonality, thus resisting the urge to
"jump to the framework" and instead just let it emerge.
