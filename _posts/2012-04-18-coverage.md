[Martin Fowler on Test Coverage](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html):

> Like most aspects of programming, testing requires thoughtfulness. 
> TDD is a very useful, but certainly not sufficient, tool to help you get good tests.

I have always said something similar: "High test coverage isn't necessarily good, but low test coverage is always bad."
